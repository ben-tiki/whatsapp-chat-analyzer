# Usage
Please follow the steps in this [link](https://faq.whatsapp.com/196737011380816/?locale=en_US) in order to Export Your WhatsApp Chat History. Note that chat exports are individual (one chat at a time) and they have a maximum length of 10,000 messages.

This export will generate a "_chat.txt" file. In order to perform the EDA on the file, simply clone the repository,  drag and drop the file into the directory and run the whatsapp_analytics Jupyter Notebook.
